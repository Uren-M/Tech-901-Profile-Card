                    <p>Hi! It's nice to meet you. My name is Uren, but you can call me Tamar (I know Uren is a bit difficult to pronounce. Lol). I'm sure your mind is racing with thoughts of "Oh that's a strange name", "Where is she from?", and so on. Well, to answer your question, I am from Nigeria (the Face of Africa)</p>
                    <p>I am a college freshman majoring in Computer Science at The Lemoyne Owen College.</p> 
                    <p> I enjoy coding in my free time and reading educational books. Some times, I watch a movie or two, but that rarely happens.</p> 
                    <p>I am passionate about bridging the gap that exists between Technology and Business, and also giving a voice to people from underrepresented communities like mine.</p>
                    <p> I aspire to pursue a career in Web programming when I graduate from college, and work for one of the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley.</p>
